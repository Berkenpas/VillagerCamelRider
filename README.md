# Villager Camel Rider

A Paper plugin for Minecraft 1.21+ that lets you make villagers ride camels—just like players do!
Lightweight, vanilla-compatible, and requires **no client mods**.

---

## **Features**

* **Seat villagers on camels:**
  Lead a camel near a villager, then right-click the villager with a lead to seat them as a camel passenger.
* **Villager behaves like in a boat:**
  Won’t wander, panic, or despawn while riding.
* **Easy, safe dismount:**
  Right-click the camel (not sneaking) with a stick in hand to safely release the villager next to the camel.
* **Vanilla safe:**
  Does not touch world save data or alter vanilla mechanics. You can safely remove the plugin at any time.

## **How to Use**

### **Mounting a Villager**

1. **Put a lead on your camel.**
2. **Bring the camel close to a villager (within 6 blocks).**
3. **Hold a lead and right-click the villager.**

   * The nearest camel on your lead will receive the villager as a passenger (just like a player!).

### **Dismounting a Villager**

* **Right-click the camel (not sneaking) with a stick in hand.**

  * The villager will safely dismount and appear next to the camel.

### **Notes**

* Only one villager may ride a camel at a time (plus one player, as in vanilla).
* Villagers cannot dismount by themselves.
* If the camel dies, the villager will be released safely nearby.
* All other camel and villager behavior is vanilla.
